# The Fanworks Archive

The Fanworks Archive is a place for fan fiction afficionados to find and share fan fiction! Navigate the page as if you have already signed in. The library consists of Home page, a Fandoms page and a Favorites page. 

Please note, this is barebones, simple mockup of a fanworks archive using React with a db.JSON framework. For now, there is no sign in/out or register functionality and you cannot upload stories (just their titles).  

## Functionality

Navigate from one page to another using the NavBar. 

Use the search bar in Fandoms to find authors that write stories for the fandom you're interested in. 

Favorite or unfavorite authors. Favorited authors can be found on the Favorites page. 

Post works anonymously from the Home page!
